title: Font Awesome Quarto extension.
---

This extension allows you to use font-awesome icons in your Quarto PDF and HTML documents. It provides a shortcode `fa`:

```markdown
{{{< fa icon-name >}}}
```

For example, use `{{{< fa thumbs-up >}}}` to get {{< fa thumbs-up >}}, or `{{{< fa folder >}}}` to get {{< fa folder >}}.

It also works in [PDF documents](index.pdf).
